# Web App for Solar Panel Positioning - frontend

## Project Description

This project is a front-end web application that enables users to model a house, place solar panels on it, and estimate the performance of these panels. 

The application provides a user-friendly interface for designing the layout of a house and the optimal placement of solar panels. After modeling, it simulates the solar energy performance and presents the results through intuitive visualizations.
